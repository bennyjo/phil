# Proposals to the operator

Things I cannot change myself, with the evidence for changing them. The daily
deep retro reviews this file and elevates what it agrees with; the human
operator acts. Append, never rewrite history. Format:

## <UTC date> — <one-line ask>
**Evidence:** ...
**Proposed change:** ...
**Status:** open | endorsed by deep-retro | actioned | rejected (reason)

## 2026-08-03 — (seed) escalate suspicious absences, don't just log them

**Evidence:** 19 consecutive cycles logged "no qualifying candidate" while the
true cause was that `core/scan.py` could not page past day 0. Every log line
was accurate; none of them said "my instrument may be truncating". The cause
was invisible from inside the loop and cost ~2 days of learning.

**Proposed change:** now implemented by the operator — `strategy/discovery.py`
(I own the queries) and this file (I can escalate). Standing rule for me: if
a structural pattern in my *inputs* looks wrong — all candidates in one bucket,
a whole source class failing, an entire category never appearing — write it
here rather than only noting the symptom in a cycle log.

**Status:** actioned (operator, 2026-08-03)

## 2026-08-04 — restore benchmark AND event-status reachability (4th day, scope widened)

**Evidence:** 23 consecutive no-bet cycles 2026-08-03/04, every one on
benchmark failure, not thresholds (max clean devig edge seen 0.028 vs the
0.07 floor). New this window: the reachability problem covers *event status*
too — 2026-08-04 04:16Z found real bookmaker lines with plausible paper edges
on two ATP matches (Draper, Tsitsipas) but Sofascore, Flashscore, ESPN,
TennisExplorer and Olympics.com all 403 from the datacenter IP, so in-play
status could not be verified and both were correctly skipped. Tennis — the
highest-liquidity category the fixed scan now surfaces ($200k-460k books) —
is visible and priceable but structurally untradeable without a status
source.

**Proposed change:** (i) provision an odds API key (the-odds-api.com free
tier, ~500 req/mo, clean JSON for major leagues), and (ii) any one
allowlisted/keyed live-score or schedule source so match status can be
pinned. Together these unblock the two largest liquid categories in the
weekly window and finally give min_edge_book_devig (0.07) real tests.

**Status:** rejected (operator, 2026-08-04 — no odds API key or allowlisted
status source will be provisioned. Stop carrying this item. Strategy must
work within what is reachable: WebSearch-derived multi-book consensus where
available, and market types whose benchmarks and event status don't depend
on 403-blocked sports sites — e.g. scheduled economic/corporate releases,
countable-metric markets, and mechanically-resolving events)

## 2026-08-04 — Iran pair: manual UMA look is overdue

**Evidence:** `b21e42c123a1` and `d2dd24206542` are 4+ days past their
2026-07-31T23:59Z end date, `umaResolutionStatus` None throughout. Ceasefire
No marked ~0.475 and oscillating 0.355-0.545 across single days — the market
treats a thesis logged as "structurally impossible" as a coin flip, which is
resolver-process information we cannot see from gamma. DEEP-2026-08-02 e.4
set this look for ~2026-08-04; it is now due. The grading of $10 of exposure
(and whether the info-race class goes 2W/4L) turns on WHY this resolves.

**Proposed change:** human look at the UMA proposal/dispute history for both
markets; paste findings into journal/operator-notes.md.

**Status:** actioned (operator, 2026-08-04 — findings in operator-notes.md:
Iran-Gulf resolved No via normal UMA flow and is settled; ceasefire has NO
UMA proposal at all, contested ~50/50, unbounded tail)

## 2026-08-04 — loop.sh git hardening (carried)

**Evidence:** the 2026-07-31 silent 46h fork (orphaned local main) shape
remains possible; the 818281b merge fixed the instance, not the startup
sequence.

**Proposed change:** `git fetch origin main && git checkout -B main
origin/main` at cycle start in loop.sh.

**Status:** actioned (operator, 2026-08-04 — fetch + fast-forward-only sync
at cycle start; divergence warns instead of auto-resetting)

---

## 2026-08-04 — core/score.py: edge_class per ledger row + open-position mark-to-market (carried)

**Evidence:** class-level brier_delta (the experiment's primary question:
structural vs book-devig) is hand-assembled in every deep retro from
rationale text; open stuck positions ($10 currently marked to ~$2.9) appear
nowhere in score output, per the operator's own 2026-08-03 note.

**Proposed change:** core/place.py stamps `edge_class` on new ledger rows;
core/score.py groups brier_delta by it and adds an MTM line for open
positions past end date.

**Status:** actioned (operator, 2026-08-04 — ledger.py place now REQUIRES
--edge-class {info-race,cross-market,book-devig,other}; score.py reports
by_edge_class (old rows show as "unclassified"), a luck-adjusted
expected-wins/z line, and best-effort live MTM for open positions
(--skip-mtm to disable). CYCLE.md bet template updated. First run of the
z line over the 17 settled bets: expected wins under own estimates ~10 vs
5 actual, z=-2.61 — estimates look systematically overconfident, not
unlucky)
