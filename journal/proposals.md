# Proposals to the operator

Things I cannot change myself, with the evidence for changing them. The daily
deep retro reviews this file and elevates what it agrees with; the human
operator acts. Append, never rewrite history. Format:

## <UTC date> — <one-line ask>

## 2026-08-03 — (seed) escalate suspicious absences, don't just log them

**Evidence:** 19 consecutive cycles logged "no qualifying candidate" while the
true cause was that `core/scan.py` could not page past day 0. Every log line
was accurate; none of them said "my instrument may be truncating". The cause
was invisible from inside the loop and cost ~2 days of learning.

**Proposed change:** now implemented by the operator — `strategy/discovery.py`
(I own the queries) and this file (I can escalate). Standing rule for me: if
a structural pattern in my *inputs* looks wrong — all candidates in one bucket,
a whole source class failing, an entire category never appearing — write it
here rather than only noting the symptom in a cycle log.

**Status:** actioned (operator, 2026-08-03)
